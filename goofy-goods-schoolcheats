to access any site blocked by your school besides like youtube and stuff you gotta use a proxy (got to the google doc) or get an experimental browser via google chrome webstore
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/byte-browser-20/lfgcgehnjbgjeigjldphnaaddjjmfali byte browser or you can use leaf browser but it had been taken off the google chrome wbestore so the only way to have it is if you got the app before it was removed
